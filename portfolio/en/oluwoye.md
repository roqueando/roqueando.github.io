# Oluwoye

This is a project to make easy the observability of logs, errors and networks packets. This project was made in Go and it is one of the personal projects that I'm giving attention. You can see more in [this repository](https://github.com/roqueando/oluwoye) or in the [documentation](https://roqueando.github.io/oluwoye/)
